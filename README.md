# HaNoiTower_stimulation
This project was started when I first learned Java Programming a year ago and tried to draw some simple graphics using StdDraw <br>
I knew it back then that this was a classic recursive problem, but somehow I went a little bit crazy. I decided to sit down and figured out the non-recursive solution <br>
It was challenging but finally, I found out the mathematical pattern in order to solve the problem in a iterative way. <br> 
The code is kinda messy but I'm still gonna push it up here to remind myself some good old memories, haha!!
